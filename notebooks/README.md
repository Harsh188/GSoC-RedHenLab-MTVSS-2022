# Jupyter-Notebook

## Installation
In this project, I'll be running the jupyter-notebook within a singularity container. In order to do so you must first follow the installation directions to get your singularity image (.sif) setup on your HPC node or gpu node depending on where you plan to use the notebook. 

## Usage
There are two locations to spin up the jupyter-notebooks.

1. HPC Login Node
This would be the standard 

2. GPU Node

### Within HPC login node

### Within GPU node
